# Global object class

# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and `conf/routes`)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration

# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:

logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
